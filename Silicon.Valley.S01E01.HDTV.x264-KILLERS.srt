00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
Saksham is awesome

1
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,760
Whoo. Yeah.

2
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:25,180
Somebody make some
motherfucking noise in here!

3
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,930
Fuck these people.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,610
Man, this place is unbelievable.

5
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,160
Fucking Goolybib, man.

6
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,990
Those guys build a
mediocre piece of software,

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,910
that might be worth something someday,

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,660
and now they live here.

9
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,450
There's money flying
all over Silicon Valley

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,950
but none of it ever seems to hit us.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,710
What the hell are you eating?

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,210
Liquid shrimp. It's 200 dollars a quart.

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,050
Wylie Dufresne made it.

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,390
How does it taste?

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,880
Like how I would imagine cum tastes.

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,680
You guys taking it all in?

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,800
Because this is what it looks like when

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,390
Google acquires your company
for over 200 million dollars.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,940
Look Dustin Moskovitz.

20
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,060
Elon Musk. Eric Schmidt.

21
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,740
Whatever the fuck the guy's
name is who created Photrio.

22
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,240
I mean, Kid Rock is the
poorest person here.

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,620
Apart from you guys.

24
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,950
Ok, there's 40 billion dollars

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,150
of net worth, walking around this party.

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,320
And you guys are standing
around drinking shrimp

27
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,330
and talking about what cum tastes like.

28
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,750
Yeah, I heard that. You
guys live in my Incubator

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,550
you've got to network. That's
why I brought you here.

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,260
I got us in here.

31
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,720
Javeed over there is my ex-room-mate.

32
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,390
Yeah, but I drove.

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,760
Eric Schmidt, Erlich Bachman.

34
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,930
It's amazing how the men
and women at these things

35
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,610
always separate like this.

36
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,350
Yeah, every party in Silicon Valley
ends up like a hasidic wedding.

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,940
Not even the Goolybib guys
were talking to girls.

38
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,770
They don't have to, Big Head.

39
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,610
This house talks to girls.

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,830
Hello! Whoo!

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,870
I got seven words for you.

42
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,130
I love

43
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,130
Goolybib's integrated-

44
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,870
multi-platform-functionality!

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,040
Yeah! Whoo!

46
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,310
But seriously,

47
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,970
you know, a few days ago, when we
were sitting down with Barak Obama,

48
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,310
I turned to these guys and said,

49
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,350
"ok, you know, we're making a lot of money.

50
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,720
And yes, we're disrupting digital media.

51
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,610
But most importantly

52
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,310
we're making the world a better place.

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,660
Through constructing elegant

54
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,400
hierarchies for maximum code
reuse and extensibility."

55
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,210
So everyone.

56
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,160
Here's to many more
nights just like this one.

57
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,750
Take it away, my good friend, Kid Rock.

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,670
What a dick.

59

60
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,730
Big Head, there is a personal ad section

61
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,020
on this asperger site.

62
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,770
Holy shit, this one is looking for

63
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,740
a "relationship that has
the potential to become

64
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,270
sexual in nature."

65
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,070
Boy, is she on the spectrum.

66
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,590
She can't even make eye
contact with the camera.

67
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,280
Richard, can I talk to you for a second?

68
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,780
- Solo.
- Mm-hmm.

69
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,380
We need to talk about Pied Piper.

70
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,040
What about it? The
website's up and running,

71
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,510
I'm just redesigning the
compression. It just needs users.

72
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,540
Yeah, no shit.

73
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,180
But even if somebody wanted to use it

74
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,960
they wouldn't be able to figure
out how to. It's incomprehensible.

75
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,380
Now, Richard, when you pitched me

76
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,720
Pied Piper you said it was
gonna be, "the Google of music."

77
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,550
Which is a really rad
way to pitch something.

78
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,970
I mean, I liked it. I thought
it had "applications".

79
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,470
No, it has all that.
Look, when it blows up,

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,860
and it will once it reaches
a critical mass of users,

81
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,060
Pied Piper will be able
to search the whole world

82
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,560
of recorded music to find out
if there's a match to see if

83
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,570
you're infringing on any
copyrighted material.

84
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,240
So, if you're a song writer or a band...

85
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,620
Ok, first of all, nobody gives a shit

86
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,910
about stealing other people's music, ok?

87
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,790
Everybody involved in the music industry

88
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,210
is either stealing it or sharing it.

89
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,240
They're all a bunch of
assholes, especially Radiohead.

90
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,630
- Look, Richard...
- No.

91
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,960
Yeah, they're assholes.

92
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,170
Now, look, Richard, if
you want to live here,

93
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,430
you've got to deliver.

94
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,420
I can't have dead weight
at my Incubator, ok?

95
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,760
Either that, or show some
promise for fuck's sake.

96
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,640
Like NipAlert, Big Head's app.

97
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,430
It gives you the location of
a woman with erect nipples.

98
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,100
Now, that's something people want.

99
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,280
Richard, you need to get
in touch with humanity.

100
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,520
When I sold my company, Aviato,

101
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,320
I wanted to give back. That's
why I started this place,

102
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,990
to do something big. To make a difference.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,910
You know, like Steve.

104
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,870
Uh, Jobs or Wozniak?

105
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,030
Steve Jobs or Steve...

106
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,290
Oh, I heard you.

107
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,750
- Which one?
- Jobs.

108
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,010
I mean, Jobs was a poser.
He didn't even write code.

109
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,010
You just disappeared up your own asshole.

110
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,770
- You know that? You did.
- Well, technically...

111
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,430
Big Head, I'm gonna be meditating.

112
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:18,020
He knew how to package the
ideas, but it was Wozniak that...

113
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,810
What is Hooli? Excellent question.

114
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,450
Hooli isn't just another high tech company.

115
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,530
Hooli isn't just about software.

116
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,070
Hooli. Hooli is about people.

117
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,820
Hooli is about innovative technology

118
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,570
that makes a difference,

119
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,710
transforming the world as we know it.

120
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,830
Making the world a better place,

121
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,130
through minimal message
oriented transport layers.

122
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,420
I firmly believe we can
only achieve greatness

123
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:50,420
if first we achieve goodness.

124
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,180
Erlich is gonna kick me out.

125
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,140
And I can't afford to pay rent here.

126
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,650
It's insane. $2800 a month,

127
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,070
$4500 a month... With five people.

128
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,600
Jesus! Why is it so expensive here?

129
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,030
Look at this place, it's a shithole.

130
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,440
Uh-oh. Here's another one.

131
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,040
Miss Palo Alto, 2K14.

132
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,870
There she goes.

133
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,380
Oh God, the marketing team is
having another bike meeting.

134
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,170
Douchebags.

135
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,720
Yup, another day inside the
Gavin Belson cult compound.

136
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,340
Hey, did you hear what
Peter Gregory is doing?

137
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,130
You mean buying that island in the Pacific?

138
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,770
No, he's building one actually.

139
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,350
Baller.

140
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,390
Anyway, he's also offering a hundred k

141
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,220
to people willing to skip
or drop out of college

142
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,640
to pursue their idea.

143
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,940
I don't know what happened to that guy,

144
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,400
but he really hates college.

145
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,200
Anyway, he's doing a TED
talks in Palo Alto tonight.

146
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,900
- We should try to get in.
- I dropped out of college.

147
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,120
Maybe I should re-enroll
and drop out again.

148
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,000
Try and get the money.

149
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,960
Brogrammers.

150
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,250
Oh, no, no.

151
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,410
Hey, uh, a double macchiato for me, dude.

152
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,180
Yeah.

153
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,920
Hey, Rico, you been working out?

154
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,940
No. No, I have not.

155
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,920
I don't have time to even if I wanted to.

156
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,560
I'm too busy working on my website.

157
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,180
Uh, I just, I don't want to
end up being a Hooli lifer.

158
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,760
You know, working here forever.

159
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,930
Yeah, working for the most
innovative company in the world,

160
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,190
with top pay and vested stock options.

161
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,950
I can totally see why
you wouldn't want that.

162
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,490
Yeah, you're like an
artist. An entrepreneur.

163
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,120
An iconoclast.

164
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,030
I don't know, maybe.

165
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,120
Dude, we're just messing with you.

166
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,630
But we really want to
help you with your site.

167
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,450
What's it called?

168
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,120
Pied Piper.

169
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,760
- Dude, sounds amazing.
- Yeah.

170
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,960
Why don't you shoot it over to
us and we'll give it a look.

171
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,640
Maybe we can help.

172
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,600
- Uh, really?
- Yeah.

173
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,970
Ok, yeah.

174
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,440
I mean it's always good
to have more eyes on it.

175
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,890
It's... sent it.

176
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,360
Oh, you're making fun of me.

177
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,730
- Dude, no.
- No, you are.

178
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,530
- Aw, Ricky, man.
- Ricky. Ricky, come back.

179
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,240
It's actually Richard, so that's...

180
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:21,320
- Pied wiper.
- Wide diaper.

181
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,990
Gates, Ellison,

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,500
Jobs, Dell.

183
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,250
All dropped out of college.

184
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,670
Silicon Valley is the cradle of innovation

185
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,760
because of drop outs.

186
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,180
College... has become a cruel

187
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,360
expensive joke on the poor

188
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,100
and the middle class

189
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,990
that benefits only the perpetrators of it.

190
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,110
- The bloated administrators.
- You are a dangerous man,

191
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,830
spewing ignorance!

192
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,250
I don't think so.

193
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm just saying people
should trust themselves

194
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,290
more than a system that happily
churns out unemployed debtors

195
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,620
and provides dubious value.

196
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,850
The true value of a college
education is intangible.

197
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,850
The true value of snake-oil
is intangible as well.

198
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,000
Fascist.

199
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,140
Anything?

200
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,140
The usual riffs on twitter and instagram.

201
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,570
Nothing I'd fund.

202
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,870
Hi, excuse me, Mr. Gregory?

203
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,980
I have an idea I'd love to
pitch you, if you have time.

204
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,150
Oh.

205
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,410
Well, that is before I just
give up and go back to college.

206
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,750
Don't! Do not do that.

207
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,420
Go work at Burger King.

208
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,800
Go into the woods and
forage for nuts and berries.

209
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,930
Do not go back to college!

210
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,430
I think I have been played.

211
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,390
Fine. Go ahead and pitch.

212
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,760
You have until I fasten
the seat-belt in my car.

213
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,590
Thank you so much.

214
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,110
Pied Piper is a proprietary
site that lets you find out

215
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,150
if your music is infringing
on any existing copyrights.

216
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,110
So, imagine you were a song writer, ok?

217
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,290
I don't think I could write a song.

218
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,320
Yeah, no, just imagine if you were.

219
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,360
I don't even think I could say,
"Pied Piper is a proprietary site."

220
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,580
Well, I just did but it wasn't easy.

221
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,080
Crunching all those songs

222
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,420
to find matches sounds like it would
take incredible processing power.

223
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,370
- I mean...
- Yes.

224
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,620
Yes, it does.

225
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,510
No, no. Its... I made an algorithm.

226
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,220
Look, why don't you send me a link to
your project and we'll take a look.

227
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,220
Ok, yeah, great.

228
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,690
I put the prototype up on github.

229
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,970
Pied Piper. I'll look it up.

230
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,440
It's like the fable with the kids

231
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,620
and then the rats and the music.

232
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,490
That is a narrow car.

233
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,960
Fucking billionaires.

234
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,170
Hey, wanna check out twig-boy's website?

235
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,250
Yes, I do.

236
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,670
You have to download your own media player?

237
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,890
Ahh.

238
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:29,350
Look at me, I traveled back to 2009.

239
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,930
Wait a sec.

240
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,580
What is this file size?

241
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,900
1.2 megabytes? No way.

242
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,940
Wow, that doesn't sound at all downgraded.

243
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,660
The file size is like, half.

244
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:48,040
And look how fast this search is.

245
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,340
Holy shit, how did it
find a match that fast?

246
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,540
It's like it's searching compressed files?

247
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,010
No way.

248
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,630
Look at that weissman score.

249
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,380
2.89.

250
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,630
Hey, where have you two been?

251
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,900
We're playing the multi-channel
router team in five minutes.

252
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,110
Ok, how the hell did he do this?

253
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,400
And the compression is totally lossless.

254
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:25,650
And he's somehow figured out a way to
do a search on a compressed data space.

255
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,320
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

256
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,290
And I don't think he even
realizes what he has here.

257
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,250
He's using it for some
silly songwriter app.

258
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,090
All these guys are like that,
they're all about consumer facing.

259
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,960
Right, but you take something like this,

260
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,760
make it business facing
and use it for enterprise?

261
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,430
The applications could be endless.

262
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,970
Hey, I thought you were a satanist?

263
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,310
I'm a LaVeyan Satanist

264
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,100
with some theistic tendencies.

265
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,560
Oh, some theistic tendencies.

266
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,980
Well then, what's with the cross?

267
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,260
It's an upside down cross.

268
00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:00,020
Not from here it isn't.

269
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,910
Oh, I see, you know what you should do?

270
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,660
You should get another tattoo
that says, "this side up" on it.

271
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,290
How does this translate into Farsi?

272
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,910
That's not the language I speak.

273
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,950
Frontier Airlines just
happened to like mine, Aviato.

274
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,200
And that's how I got to where I am.

275
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,790
So... what do you got?

276
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,870
Ok, here it is.

277
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,960
Bit Soup.

278
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,960
It's like alphabet soup but

279
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:32,440
it's ones and zeros instead of the letters.

280
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,560
'Cause it's binary. You know,
binary is just ones and zeroes.

281
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,940
Yeah, I know what binary is.

282
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,440
Jesus Christ! I memorized
the hexadecimal times tables

283
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,730
when I was 14 writing machine code!

284
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,030
Ok. Ask me what nine times f is.

285
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,490
It's fleventyfive.

286
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,620
I do not need you telling
me what binary is,

287
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,590
just like I don't need you thinking
about soup or taking pictures of it.

288
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,370
I need you thinking about
apps, software, websites.

289
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:00,330
This is Silicon Valley, all right, not...

290
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,720
Paris, Texas.

291
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,620
That's where Campbell's soup is.

292
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,340
It's the Hooli number again.

293
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,840
It's probably those brogrammers.

294
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,060
Can't wait to tell me
how stupid my website is.

295
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,400
Assholes.

296
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,980
Hello, Richard Hendricks.
I'm a total fucking retard.

297
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,350
Uh. Hi, this is Jared
Dunn calling from Hooli.

298
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,690
I'm calling a behalf of Gavin Belson.

299
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,690
I didn't... hi.

300
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,160
Gavin is very excited about
your Pied Piper application

301
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,000
and we were wondering if you could come in

302
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,750
for a sit-down with us.

303
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,710
- Are you available now.
- Ok.

304
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,550
- Sure. Yes.
- Ok, we'll be here.

305
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,550
Good-bye.

306
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,890
Uh, I have a meeting with Gavin Belson.

307
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,430
He likes Pied Piper.

308
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,300
- Holy shit.
- I own 10 percent of Pied Piper.

309
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,710
You said it was a shitty idea.

310
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,770
It was a shitty idea.

311
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,380
I'm not sure what it is now.

312
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,600
- What time's the meeting?
- Right now.

313
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,810
I'm gonna need a better shirt.

314
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,140
Holy shit.

315
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,460
What the fuck am I waiting for? See ya.

316
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,490
Well, it's like Gavin always says,
"it takes change to make change."

317
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,760
Yeah, I think I've seen
that written around.

318
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,720
- Hey.
- Hi.

319
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,840
Gavin is running 30 minutes late

320
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,430
but you should know he is very
excited to see you, Richard.

321
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,840
He's with his spiritual advisor.

322
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,560
He shouldn't be that much longer.

323
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,930
I'm a VP here and I only get to
see him about ten minutes a month.

324
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,180
But that 10 minutes is just incredible.

325
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,990
I heard Richard Hendricks was here.

326
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,110
Have you ever met Gavin before?

327
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,770
- No.
- No?

328
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,450
Oh, I told him, it's amazing.

329
00:15:54,450 --> 00:16:00,030
That hardly begins to describe it.

330
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,130
It's weird.

331
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,040
They always travel in groups of five.

332
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,590
These programmers, there's
always a tall skinny white guy,

333
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,760
short skinny Asian guy,

334
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,210
fat guy with a ponytail,

335
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,180
some guy with crazy facial hair

336
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,480
and then an East Indian guy.

337
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,050
It's like they trade guys until
they all have the right group.

338
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:28,390
You clearly have a great
understanding of humanity.

339
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,860
And Gavin said I'm not humiliating you,

340
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,900
I'm elevating you.

341
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,820
Ah, Gavin.

342
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,000
This is Richard.

343
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,340
It's Peter Gregory.

344
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,070
Ah, no.

345
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,130
Come on, Big Head.

346
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,750
Yeah, I'm coming. Slow...

347
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,850
Why are you going that fast?

348
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,020
We've got a meeting with Gavin
Belson. Pick up the pace.

349
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:07,230
- We honestly don't.
- Come on.

350
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,030
I'm actually outside of Gavin Belson's
office right now, Mr. Gregory.

351
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,070
Uh, here he comes, so
can I call you back in...

352
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:20,000
So, Richard Hendricks is here!

353
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,360
There you are, Richard.

354
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,780
So sorry these gentleman
have kept you waiting.

355
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,250
- That's fine.
- So here's the thing.

356
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,470
I love what you did.

357
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,710
- Really?
- Fill him in, Jared.

358
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,550
Now, as you know, Hooli is seen as possibly

359
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,760
the most progressive company in the world.

360
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,300
Part of that is Gavin's
commitment to social justice,

361
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,880
but part of it is his personal commitment

362
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,060
to the people that work at Hooli.

363
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,390
In that spirit Gavin is prepared to
give you a very substantial raise...

364
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,860
And a promotion to go with it.

365
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,890
I own 10 percent.

366
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,890
He created it while living in my Incubator.

367
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,400
Erlich Bachman. This is Big Head.

368
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,410
I don't know what any of that means, but I'll
give you six hundred thousand dollars for it.

369
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,400
We have the reach and the resources
to take what you have done

370
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,370
and push it to the global level.

371
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,490
That is a generous offer.

372
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,080
Shit, sorry. Hello.

373
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,580
Really? No shit, that's...

374
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,260
Uh, yeah, yeah. No here.
It's Peter Gregory.

375
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,810
Not sure how he got my number?

376
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,140
Uh, this is Richard.

377
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,600
I'll give you three million
dollars for it right now!

378
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,150
Ah, Gavin Belson just offered me
three million dollars for Pied Piper.

379
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,600
I'm prepared to give you three
hundred thousand dollars.

380
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,270
Peter Gregory just offered me 300, um...

381
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,030
Did you say thousand dollars?

382
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,740
For ten percent of your company.

383
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,360
Ok, four million.

384
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,680
200 thousand.

385
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,830
- For five percent.
- Huh?

386
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,960
You just went down.

387
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,630
No, you're still valued
at four million dollars.

388
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:59,010
But you own ninety-five percent of
a potential billion-dollar company.

389
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,650
And not just that, I will
help you build this company.

390
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,430
I will introduce you to
the people you need to know

391
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,770
and provide the counsel that you need.

392
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,190
I will take a small piece, but
the company will belong to you.

393
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,140
Not Gavin Belson.

394
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,990
You have until tomorrow to decide.

395
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,120
Ah, ok.

396
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,040
- Um, you know.
- Pull your head out of your ass, Richard.

397
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,910
I'm offering you four
million dollars right now.

398
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,660
I'm...

399
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:36,580
That is a lot of money.

400
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,330
You know, I actually have to...

401
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,680
I've got to go to the bathroom.

402
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,140
I've got to pee.

403
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,590
It's desperate. I'm bursting.

404
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,340
I'll be right back, but right now...

405
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,680
Ok, 10 million.

406
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,360
No. Maybe.

407
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,520
I didn't mean to snap at you.

408
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,270
I'll talk... in a bit.

409
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,310
Won't be long.

410
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,360
Little more about me.

411
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,910
I am the founder of Aviato.

412
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,530
And I own a very small
percentage of Grindr.

413
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,450
It's a men to men dating site

414
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,280
where you can find other
men within 10 miles of you.

415
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,290
Interested in having sexual
intercourse in a public restroom.

416
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,490
In the homosexual community
there's sometimes anonymous...

417
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,840
I know what Grindr is.

418
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,230
I have gay friends.

419
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,860
So you will survive.

420
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,560
It's just a garden variety panic attack.

421
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,190
Welcome to Silicon Valley.

422
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,060
We see people like you all the time.

423
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,780
- Really?
- Yes.

424
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,200
It's just I have to make
this decision by tomorrow.

425
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,740
Yeah. You know, a while back,

426
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,990
we had a guy in here in almost
the exact same situation,

427
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,870
"take the money or keep the company."

428
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,040
What happened?

429
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,830
Well, a couple months later

430
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,210
he was brought into the ER with
a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

431
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,080
I guess he really regretted
not taking that money.

432
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,300
He shot himself because
he turned down the money?

433
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,970
Yeah.

434
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,270
Or no, he took the money.

435
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,260
Or no.

436
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,640
No, he did not. I don't... You know what?

437
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,270
I don't remember. But whatever it was,

438
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,060
he regretted it so much that
he ended up shooting himself.

439
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,400
- And now he's blind.
- He's blind?

440
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,320
Yeah, just fyi, if you're
ever gonna shoot yourself,

441
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,940
don't hold the gun up to your temple, ok?

442
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,070
Because that just basically just took out

443
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,610
both of his optic nerves and then,

444
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,190
you know, half of his face.

445
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,910
And then his wife left
him, because, you know.

446
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,950
- Yikes.
- Right.

447
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,530
He may have been a genius programmer

448
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,290
but not so much in human anatomy.

449
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,450
Or decision making, for that matter.

450
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,790
Now he's got to live with all that

451
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,800
and whatever terrible decision
he made about the money.

452
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,930
Uh. And what do I do if I feel
another panic attack coming on.

453
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,430
Would you be interested in a device

454
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,020
that links up to your
smartphone and it keeps track

455
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,650
of your vitals and it tells
you, even before it's happening,

456
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,440
whether you're having a panic
attack or an actual heart attack?

457
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,640
Yeah, that sounds great.

458
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,860
You would, right? Ok, that's great news.

459
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,060
Because it's still in
prototype phase right now,

460
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,660
but my start-up partners and
I are looking for investors.

461
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,150
Like today. So will you
please let me know...

462
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,320
I'm going to give you my number.

463
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,330
If you do end up taking
that 10 million dollars

464
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,740
because we could really make
the world a better place.

465
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,720
Whoa! Oh, jeez!

466
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,140
Richard.

467
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,050
Hi, Monica. I work with Peter Gregory.

468
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,420
- We met outside the TED...
- Yeah, I remember you.

469
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,350
What... how'd you know I was here?

470
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,010
Peter Gregory is invested in a company

471
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,430
that uses GPS in phones to track people.

472
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,200
That's creepy.

473
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,490
You don't know the half of it.

474
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,770
And neither does congress.

475
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,330
- Are you ok?
- Look, I don't want to waste your time.

476
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,860
I think I gotta take the
money from Gavin Belson.

477
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,080
At least this way when
I blow my eyeballs out

478
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,250
I'll have some money left for my family.

479
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,540
Jesus.

480
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,960
Sorry. That is a terrible doctor in there.

481
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,390
Richard, buried in that clunky UI of yours

482
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:11,550
is a compression algorithm that
blew our engineering team away.

483
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,890
And what do you think Hooli
is going to do with it?

484
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,020
I don't know. That's their business.

485
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,470
This is your baby.

486
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,890
Do you even realize the
impact that a compression

487
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,940
this good could have on the world?

488
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,310
Getting any file on your
mobile phone in an instant.

489
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,530
Navigation data for self-driving cars,

490
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,900
mobile medical imagery,

491
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,480
all transmitting with no quality loss.

492
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,650
This is game-changing.

493
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,240
Don't you want to be in the
driver's seat when that happens?

494
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,920
You really want to just turn it
all over to Hooli and walk away?

495
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,170
Well, you are not making
this easier for me.

496
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,590
I'm not trying to.

497
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,140
I mean you're actually making it worse.

498
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,670
My hands are tingling. I have
this metal taste in my mouth.

499
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,340
Actually, I can't go back in
there, so I'm going to go home.

500
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,060
- Let me give you a ride home.
- Good to see you again.

501
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,820
Uh, ok. Thanks.

502
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,900
Dude, where have you been?

503
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,440
Why won't you answer your phone?

504
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,280
Man, this has grown way beyond angellist.

505
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,780
Andreesen, elevation and like a bunch of
other seed funds are piling onto this thing.

506
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,270
I mean, they've been calling Erlich.

507
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,120
He's out of control.

508
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,700
Yeah.

509
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,620
What if we took Peter Gregory's 200k

510
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,120
and built our own company?

511
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,460
I'm sorry. You said we.

512
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,670
Who's that in reference to exactly?

513
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,870
You, me, Dinesh, Big Head, us.

514
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,510
I mean, right now Pied
Piper just does audio,

515
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,430
but I'm thinking of ways to
compress images, video...

516
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,310
I mean, maybe Peter Gregory's right.

517
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,010
Maybe this could be huge.

518
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,140
Look, guys, for thousands of years

519
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,640
guys like us have gotten
the shit kicked out of us.

520
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,860
But now, for the first time,
we are living in an era

521
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,940
where we can be in
charge and build empires.

522
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,730
We could be the vikings of our day.

523
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,870
- Vikings?
- How are you feeling?

524
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,950
You look super fucked up to be honest.

525
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,320
Who ate my fucking quinoa again?

526
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,990
So you're really about to go tell Erlich that
he's not going to get his one million dollars?

527
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,160
Yeah, I don't want to be
there when you do that.

528
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,670
I would like to be there when you do that.

529
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:11,750
No, just stay here, please.

530
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,750
Hey.

531
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,340
Um, so, I've been thinking about

532
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,510
this whole Peter Gregory,
Gavin Belson thing.

533
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,180
And, um, I think I'm going
to go with Peter Gregory.

534
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,190
- Uh, which I know means...
- Richard.

535
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,460
I know that you look at me, and see
a guy who has it all figured out.

536
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,530
And for the most part, you're right, I do.

537
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,950
When I sold Aviato,

538
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,750
it gave me a house, money, fancy clothes,

539
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,890
the universal respect of all the ladies.

540
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,710
But there's always been a hole in my heart.

541
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,220
Not a literal hole like you would find

542
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,380
in some babies with congenital diseases,

543
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,380
but a metaphorical hole.

544
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,880
I guess that hole is the "what if".

545
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,680
What if I didn't sell?

546
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,520
I'll never know.

547
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,220
And so I guess what I'm
saying to you now is,

548
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,470
you're like me, Richard.

549
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,560
You want to build something

550
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,280
and see it through.

551
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,650
So, just to be clear.

552
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,820
You're all right with
me saying no to a deal

553
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,900
that will net you a
million dollars outright?

554
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,750
No, Richard. I'm not all right with it.

555
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,070
I'm excited about it.

556
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,630
Let's see how high this
rocket can fly, partner.

557
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,580
Ok. Great.

558
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,050
That's great.

559
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,670
Not partners, exactly.

560
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,660
But everything else is great.

561
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:46,300
Call it what you want.

562
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,930
Always blue,
always blue, always blue,

563
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,680
always blue, always blue, always blue,

564
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,570
always blue, always...

565
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,350
Oh! That was a yellow.

566
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,660
What was that, 17?

567
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,490
- Pretty good.
- Hey, guys...

568
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,080
Guys, can I just kind of
say something real quick?

569
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,450
I know it's stupid but, um...

570
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,830
I just want to say, uh,

571
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,750
I'd like for this company
to be different than Hooli

572
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,630
and Goolybib and all the rest, you know?

573
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,840
Like, let's like not turn
this into a corporate cult

574
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,130
with bike meetings and voluntary retreats

575
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,840
that are actually mandatory.

576
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,850
And claiming to make the world
a better place all the time.

577
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,130
Let's, uh, let's just think different.

578
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,550
Don't think different. That's Apple.

579
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,690
Uh, umm...

580
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,470
Let's just... Let's just do it.

581
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,280
- That's Nike, man.
- I know that's nike.

582
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,140
- Yeah.
- Uh...

583
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,320
Fuck it. I don't know.

584
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,110
Let's just make it...
Let's just make it happen.

585
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,570
Yeah, agreed.

586
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,830
To his beneficence.

587
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,320
Peter Gregory?

588
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,990
- The Dark Lord.
- Of course, The Dark Lord.

589
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,160
Big Head.

590
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,000
God, he's worse high.

591
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,390
Always blue, always blue,
always blue, always blue...

592
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:16,600
